# Sudoku_Game
A Sudoku game made with python-pygame. The package is divided into 3 files: a generator script, a solver script, and the game script.

To play the game, use mouse to click and type in what you think should be the correct answer for each position in the board. 
Once sure of your answer, press enter to lock it in. If you are correct, the console would print success, else it would print wrong.

Have Fun!
